# 🏥 ED Tracker — Emergency Department Patient Management Tool

A lightweight, fast, and clean Emergency Department (ED) tracker built using **React + Vite**.  
Designed to replicate the functionality of real-world NHS ED systems such as EDIS, Symphony, and Medway — but simpler, faster, and customisable.

This tool lets clinicians quickly view patient flow, monitor tasks, document notes, and track NEWS scores.
